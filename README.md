  <b>Nowoczesny, minimalistyczny interfejs graficzny dla Stable Diffusion 1.5.</b>
  <br>
  <i>Zaprojektowany w PyQt6 z myślą o wygodzie, estetyce i ochronie VRAM.</i>

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🖌️ Smart Generation Modes

* **Text2Image** — Full control over the diffusion process: sampler, scheduler, CFG, steps, and dimensions.
* **Inpainting (Editing)** — Advanced interactive canvas (`QGraphicsView`) for drawing precise binary masks. Features full **Undo/Redo** history (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y) and image centering. Supports dedicated inpainting models and component sharing (saves VRAM).
* **ControlNet (Canny)** — Edge-based generation from a reference image with smart scaling and OpenCV edge detection.
* **Upscaler** — High-quality image upscaling support powered by the `spandrel` library.

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings (`settings.ini`)

* **First Launch Wizard** — A welcoming setup guide to help you configure your initial language and theme preferences.
* **Modular Configuration** — Complete freedom in defining model paths and output directories.
* **Dynamic Themes** — Seamless switching between **Dark** and **Light** modes with customizable accent colors.
* **Performance Tweaks** — Optional VRAM Slicing and VAE Tiling for low-memory cards.
* **i18n System (Multilingual Support)** — The application is fully prepared for multiple languages via JSON files (`locales/`). It officially supports English and Polish out of the box, but **you can easily add your own custom language** by simply dropping a new JSON file into the folder.

### 📦 Asset Management

* **Autonomous Refreshing** — Thanks to `QFileSystemWatcher`, the interface dynamically reacts to new models/LoRAs added to the disk without restarting the app, smartly retaining your current selections.
* **Latent Mixology Station** — A mixer for up to 5 LoRA adapters simultaneously with a visual weight equalizer. It automatically reloads active adapters when switching base models and physically unloads them to prevent memory conflicts.
* **Smart Scanner** — Automatic detection of `.safetensors`, `.pth`, `.onnx`, and other common model formats.

### 📊 VRAM Oracle & Optimization

* Real-time GPU memory consumption estimation with color-coded warnings.
* **Auto-Optimizer** — A one-click button to restore safe resolution settings.
* **Zero-Copy Memory** — Highly efficient image conversion between the AI engine (PIL) and the UI (QImage) via direct memory views, eliminating CPU bottlenecks and ensuring memory stability (prevents SegFaults).

### 🖼️ Gallery & PNG Info

* Browse your creations using the built-in file explorer.
* **Recall Parameters** — Read the prompt, seed, and generation settings directly from PNG metadata and restore them to the pipeline with a single click.
* **Floating Tips** — Interactive HTML documentation and guides available as floating windows within the app.
